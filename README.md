# Summary

<p>
A <b>simulation</b> as it is understood here is an approximate imitation of a process or system
over a sequence. The sequence can be time but also any other type.
</p> 

<p>
This project tries to develop solutions for certain business problems with simulations of
<b>probability distributions</b>.
In this context, it helps bring into mind that simulations
are nothing more than a tool under uncertainty. A simulation gives a range 
of possible outcomes depending on input probabilities. 
Are these outcomes acceptable or not? Simulations are techniques for estimating the risk
someone is willing to carry. Testing out different probability levels with charts and histograms are a search to find the desired level of risk and outcome.

A <b>Monte Carlo simulation</b> is not a stringent mathematical solution. It cannot be as it applies the concept of randomness. A MC is also not a model but a techniqe for enriching the data, when empirical data is sparse and collecting more data would be too
costly. The art of simulation is understanding the problem, fitting the adequate
probability distribution, calculate the moments, and run experiments.

This project approaches the topic of simulations from the Bernoulli distribution,
then goes to the binomial distribution, and then applies MC to a geometric probability
distribution problem.
